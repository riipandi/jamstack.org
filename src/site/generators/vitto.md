Vitto combines the speed of Vite's development experience with the simplicity of Vento templates to create a modern static site generator. Perfect for documentation sites, blogs, portfolios, and any project that needs fast builds and flexible templating without the complexity of larger frameworks.

Vitto stands out by leveraging Vite's powerful ecosystem, allowing you to:

- **Use Modern Tools**: Direct access to Vite plugins (Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS, PostCSS, etc.)

- **Integrate Easily**: Add htmx, Alpine.js, or any library via bundler or CDN.

- **Build Fast**: Lightning-fast builds with Vite's optimized pipeline.

- **Stay Simple**: Template-based approach without framework complexity.

Building websites doesn't have to be complicated.
